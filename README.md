Project Overview
The Microsoft Cybersecurity Incident Classification project aims to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model that accurately predicts the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. The model classifies incidents into three categories: True Positive (TP), Benign Positive (BP), or False Positive (FP). This classification aids SOC analysts in prioritizing incidents and responding to threats more effectively.
